//! Hosting VST2 custom editor windows (X11 embedding).
//!
//! # The standard protocol (VST2.4 spec, verified against Ardour, Carla,
//! JUCE, LMMS and yabridge host implementations)
//!
//! * `effEditOpen` (opcode 14) takes a native window handle in `ptr`. On
//!   X11 that is the **XID** of the parent window cast to a pointer; the
//!   plugin creates its editor window as a child of it (reparenting works
//!   because X object IDs are server-global — the plugin uses its own X
//!   connection and the window manager keeps decorating our container).
//! * `effEditIdle` (opcode 19) must be pumped from the GUI thread at a
//!   steady rate while the editor is open; FLTK- and DPF-based editors run
//!   their event handling from it.
//! * `effEditGetRect` (opcode 13) receives an `ERect**` — the plugin writes
//!   the address of its rect there; `ERect` holds 16-bit
//!   `top/left/bottom/right`. The host sizes its container to it; that is
//!   the resize path for fixed-size editors, while VST2.4 resizable plugins
//!   additionally call back with `audioMasterSizeWindow`.
//! * `effEditClose` (opcode 15) must be dispatched before the plugin is
//!   unloaded; the editor thread owns that ordering.
//!
//! The open is VERIFIED, not trusted: the plugin must either reparent a
//! child window with real geometry into the container or paint pixels on
//! it (compared against a sentinel background — never "non-black", the
//! container's own background is not content). Nothing appearing within
//! ~3 s means the editor is refused, the window destroyed, and the UI
//! falls back to sliders — a blank, dead panel is never left on screen.
//! The container pumps X events and honours `WM_DELETE_WINDOW` /
//! `DestroyNotify`, so the window-manager close button always works.
//!
//! THREADING: every plugin control-plane call — instantiation included —
//! runs on ONE shared "vst2-gui" thread (see `vsthost::open`), while the
//! audio thread keeps processing. This is not optional: GUI toolkits
//! (JUCE's `MessageManager`, FLTK) bind their global event loop to the
//! thread that first touches the plugin and silently refuse to show any
//! window opened elsewhere. Opening editors on a per-editor thread while
//! instantiation ran on the UI thread left every JUCE editor permanently
//! unmapped (the v10.2 "no plugin GUIs at all" report). One thread makes
//! the affinity assumption true by construction; editors are pumped
//! there in rotation (verify + idle) as state machines rather than
//! blocking loops, so several editors coexist.
//!
//! VST3 editors are not hosted through this module: the `vst3-host`
//! realtime runner confines the plugin to its processing thread, and the
//! crate's own `EmbeddedEditor` rejects Wayland window handles; see
//! docs/PLUGINS.md "VSTi custom GUIs" for the full diagnosis.
