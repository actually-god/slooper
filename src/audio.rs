//! JACK/PipeWire-JACK audio backend for slooper (DAW engine).
//!
//! A dedicated non-realtime "audio manager" thread owns the `jack::Client`.
//! The GUI talks to it over an mpsc command channel and receives state
//! updates (port lists, MIDI events, finished takes, status) on a second
//! channel.
//!
//! Port layout: the client registers a fixed pool of input/output slots
//! (`in0..`, `out0..`) plus a MIDI input once at startup, and stays
//! activated for its whole lifetime. Applying a selection only connects /
//! disconnects external ports to/from the pool — it never deactivates the
//! client. (Deactivating is unsafe here: the jack crate's `deactivate` only
//! clears the thread-init/process callbacks, leaving notification callbacks
//! registered against handler memory that is then freed — a use-after-free
//! on PipeWire-JACK.) The realtime process handler reads two atomic
//! "connected" masks and mixes only enabled slots, so no locking or stale
//! port state ever enters the audio path.
//!
//! Playback model: ONE global transport clock drives the whole project. The
//! musical content is an [`Arrangement`] (tracks → lanes → clips) plus an
//! asset table, both shared as immutable Arc snapshots the GUI swaps in with
//! [`Cmd::SetProject`]; the realtime path walks the timeline and sums every
//! clip the playhead crosses. There are no per-track clocks and no overdub —
//! recording captures raw input into a take buffer and hands the finished
//! take back to the GUI (as an asset + clip placement) when stopped.
