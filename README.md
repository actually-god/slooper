# slooper

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A minimalist clip-based audio DAW built in Rust for Linux (JACK /
PipeWire-JACK). Up to sixteen tracks on one global, draggable playhead: drop
audio from the **asset rack** onto a metronome-defined bar grid, record audio
takes and MIDI takes that turn themselves into clips, play software
instruments from the built-in piano to hosted VSTi, draw notes in a piano
roll, stack child lanes additively, quantize with one click, and save whole
projects to disk — with MIDI binding, keyboard shortcuts, per-track effect +
plugin chains, and clean export.

## Features

- **Resizable tracks** — drag the separation bar under any track; only that
  track changes, its lanes always share the height equally, and a new child
  lane grows the track instead of shrinking its siblings. **Ctrl + wheel**
  zooms the timeline, **Shift + wheel** pans horizontally.
- **16-track timeline DAW model** — no per-track clocks or loop modes: one
  global transport and one **always-on playhead** over a bar/beat grid derived
  from the metronome. Press play or stop **anywhere** — the position is kept;
  **drag the playhead** across the ruler or any lane to scrub to the exact
  spot you want to hear. A per-track **play gate** (`on` / `mute`) mutes
  a track without touching its clips, and the transport bar's **PLAY/STOP**
  button (or `Space`, or bound MIDI) starts/stops everything at once. The
  visible track count is a setting (1–16); bindings for hidden tracks are
  kept, not dropped.
- **Clips from the asset rack** — every track is a lane space you drop audio
  into, not a single pre-allocated buffer. Clips are references to audio
  files: drag them from the asset rack onto any lane, drag them along the
  timeline to reposition (with snap), and stack as many as you like — clips
  that overlap simply add together.
- **Clip trimming** — select a clip and grab its edge: trim from either end,
  or keep dragging the head back outward to **re-expose the audio you cut**
  (nothing is ever destroyed — clips just window the asset). Dragging the
  tail **past the asset end** stores a silent extension (rendered as a dark
  tail with an amber *original* marker). Edges snap to the asset's own
  boundaries, and trimming snaps even when grid snap is off.
- **Group editing** — click selects, **Ctrl + click** toggles, **Shift +
  click** takes a same-lane run, **Ctrl + A** selects everything; a group
  drags sideways as one unit, and dragging a single clip across lane lines
  moves it lanes. **Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V** copies and pastes the whole
  selection **with trims and relative offsets intact** — the paste lands at
  the playhead on the last-clicked track and the view scrolls to it.
  **Ctrl + D** duplicates; **Delete** removes the group.
- **Record → take → clip** — each track keeps its **REC** button (and its
  keyboard/MIDI binding). Press REC, play, press REC again: the take is
  written as a WAV into the rack's **primary folder** (so it is instantly an
  asset for every future project) and automatically placed as a clip **at
  the playhead** in the recorded-into track — opening a child lane if the
  base lane is busy there. Takes longer than the ~60 s take buffer auto-stop.
- **MIDI recording** — the same strip carries **MREC**: arm it and slooper
  captures every *incoming MIDI message that is not bound to an action*;
  stop (button again, or stop the transport) and the take becomes a `.mid`
  asset in the primary folder plus a placed clip — playable, editable in the
  piano roll, and shown as notes on the clip itself.
- **Instruments & synths** — every track binds a synthesizer: the bundled
  **grand piano** (recorded multisample instrument built from the open
  TimGM6mb soundfont; generator in `tools/`, credit in `synths/`), the
  **sampler**
  script (plays any rack asset pitched around a root note shown as `C3`-style
  note names), or **any scanned VSTi**. Parameters open in a sliders window;
  VST2 instruments can open their native editor window (see
  [docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md)).
- **Clip polish** — one click on a clip opens its property row: per-clip
  **gain** (dB), **fade in / out** (ms, drawn as wedges on the clip),
  and **✂ split** (`S`) cuts clips at the playhead into seamless halves.

- **Piano roll** — the grid toolbar's **♫ Piano roll** opens a full-window
  note editor: with a MIDI clip or rack asset selected it **opens that
  asset for editing** (save overwrites it in place), otherwise it starts a
  fresh pattern; draw notes on the snap grid, drag to move, edge-resize,
  marquee / Ctrl / Shift select, Ctrl + C/V/A, one-click **quantize**.
  Preview routes through the picked track's *synth + effects chain*; the
  tempo follows the metronome. **save** writes the pattern as a MIDI asset
  (primary folder) and places a clip at the playhead.
- **Asset rack** — a panel on the left of the main window listing audio
  folders (add any number with **+ folder**, reorder, remove with `x`,
  re-scan with `...`). The **first folder is the primary folder**: all
  recordings are stored there. Supported import formats (WAV, MP3, OGG,
  FLAC, M4A, AAC, AIFF) are decoded and resampled to the engine rate on
  demand; `.mid` files appear with a blue **MIDI** badge; per-asset actions
  quantize, trim silence, or remove.
- **Metronome grid & easy quantize** — the metronome (BPM 20–300, beats per
  measure 1–16, six subdivisions) *is* the project clock: its tempo and
  time-signature define the visible bar grid, the ruler, and the quantize
  grid. Quantization is always metronome-based: pick a **quantize
  subdivision** (quarter … thirty-second, incl. triplets) and one click
  snaps the selected asset's content onto it (zero-crossing refinement +
  seam crossfade keep it click-free); **Trim** clips silence off the start
  and end of an asset; tick **auto-quantize** and every fresh recording is
  quantized the moment it lands. Placed clips snap to a separate **snap
  subdivision** grid — and a **snap checkbox** turns snapping off entirely
  so placements land on any single sample.
- **Projects** — Ctrl+S saves everything (grid, mixer, FX chain, synths,
  lanes, clips, asset table) into a single JSON `.slooper` file in your
  projects folder; the first save asks for a name. **Save as** re-names,
  **Load** shows every project in the folder newest-first, and the projects
  folder itself is a setting. Audio is never embedded — derived assets are
  written next to the project and missing files are re-found by name.
- **Mixer dock & effects** — a **Mixer** panel docked right of the timeline
  holds every track's full strip, each one pixel-aligned to its track block:
  name, REC, play gate, **MREC**, child-lane buttons, **vol** (−∞…+6 dB),
  **gain**, **pan** (−100…+100, equal power; editable dB / position text
  boxes, raw MIDI readout and a **0** reset button), the **FX** chain chip
  and the **synth** picker — all scrolling in lockstep with the timeline.
  The **master volume** (peak meter + one-row fader at the top of the mixer
  dock, above Track 1) spans the same −∞…+6 dB range.
- **One chain per track — scripts *and* plugins** — each track's mixer
  chain is a single ordered list mixing runtime-compiled **Rust effect
  scripts** (hot-compiled with rustc, per-effect sliders, scripted custom
  GUIs, user presets) and binary **VST2 / VST3 plugins** (parameter sliders,
  native plugin editor windows for both generations). **Plugins used as
  instruments** can be bound
  as the track's synth and played by its MIDI clips. Live and in export
  renders.
- **Global loop region** — a **loop** toggle plus mode dropdown on the grid
  toolbar: **current longest** (default — wraps at the end of the longest
  playing clip), **whole song**, or **area**, whose start and end show up as
  bright yellow grab bars on the ruler (default bar 1 → bar 2, snap-aware,
  drag anywhere). The playhead
  draws as one unbroken line across all tracks, and with looping off it
  parks at the region end.
- **Bundled TR-808 pack** — fourteen one-shots sampled from a real Roland
  TR-808 (kick, sub, snares, clap, closed/open hats, crash, cowbell, three
  toms, rimshot, clave) seed themselves into the app data dir and open as
  the default rack folder on a fresh install (public-domain lineage; see
  `samples/808/CREDITS.md`).
- **Settings menu** — hamburger (top-left): input/output port picker (per
  output **L** / **R** / both), projects folder, latency
  compensation, track count (1–16), GUI scale, MIDI + keyboard bindings for
  every action.
- **MIDI binding** — every action — per-track record / **MIDI record** /
  clear / play-gate, track select, **play all** / **stop all**, metronome,
  export, per-track volume / gain / pan knobs — binds to a live-captured
  Note, CC, or Program Change; knob bindings get two-point axis calibration
  (incl. inverted travel). Everything persists between sessions.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Space` play/stop all, `R` record, `C` clear,
  `E` export prompt, `M` metronome, `1`–`4` select track (5–16 bindable),
  Ctrl+S save (Ctrl+Shift+S rename), Ctrl+A/C/V/D select-all /
  copy / paste / duplicate. All rebindable; ignored while typing
  in text boxes; auto-repeat never re-fires.
- **Import / export** — export one track (its mixer + chain baked in), the
  whole project, or just the **current clip selection** (rendered
  time-aligned) as WAV/FLAC (built in) or MP3/OGG (via ffmpeg).
- **MIDI monitor** — permanent `slooper:midi_in` JACK MIDI port; every
  event parsed and shown in the bottom panel.
- **Latency compensation** — *latency (ms)* discards that many leading
  samples of every fresh take, so the REC click itself lands on the clip
  start. Monitoring and the output mix are never delayed.

## Requirements

- Rust (stable) and `cargo`; **`rustc` at runtime** for building effect and
  synth scripts on the fly (optional — the app runs fine without custom
  scripts)
- Build-time system libraries: JACK headers + `.pc` file (provided by
  `pipewire-jack` or the official `libjack` package), plus `pkgconf`.
  No other system deps — the GUI stack is pure-Rust.
- An X11 display (XWayland counts) for native VST2 plugin editor windows.
- `ffmpeg` (optional) for MP3/OGG export.
- A JACK-compatible audio server:
  - **PipeWire** (recommended): just install `pipewire` + `pipewire-jack`.
  - or classic **jack2** (`jackd`).

The app opens its JACK client with `NO_START`, so it will never spawn a
server for you — if none is running it shows an error and stays idle.

## Install

**Arch Linux** — once published, from the AUR:

```sh
yay -S slooper        # or paru -S slooper
```

**Any distro** — build from source (prereqs per distro in
[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/actually-god/slooper
cd slooper
cargo build --release
./target/release/slooper
```

## Using the GUI

Full walkthrough in [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md). The short version:

1. Wait for the JACK readout in the top bar (client name + sample rate).
2. Open the **hamburger** (top-left), tick your inputs and each output's
   **L** / **R** / both, **Apply Selection**. Remembered across launches.
3. Add an audio folder to the **asset rack** (+ folder) — the first one
   doubles as the recordings folder.
4. Set your tempo/meter in the transport bar (that *is* the grid), then
   either drag an asset onto a track lane, arm a track and press **REC**,
   arm **MREC** to capture MIDI, or draw notes in the **♫ Piano roll**.
5. Press `Space` to run the whole project; drag the playhead to scan.
6. Ctrl+S to save the project once it sounds right.

### Effects & plugins

Each track owns one **ordered mixer chain** — effect scripts and binary VST
plugins interleaved in one list. Click a track's **FX** chip:

- **The chain** — one row per slot, top-to-bottom *is* audio order; ↑↓
  reorder, `×` remove. A slot whose plugin/script failed to load stays
  visible as *not loaded* until the next rescan.
- **+ effect** — script effects from the effects folder; default
  `~/.local/share/slooper/effects`, created and seeded with `template.rs`
  + the ABI contract on first run; **Rescan effects** compiles edited
  scripts. The app-shipped effect scripts update in place (with a `.bak`
  backup) when they are fixed upstream.
- **+ VST plugin** — plugins scanned from your plugin folders
  (`~/.vst`, `~/.vst3`, system dirs + anything you add in the folder
  manager); **Rescan Plugins** re-reads them after installs.
- Clicking a slot opens its editor: the script's own scripted GUI or
  automatic sliders for effects, parameter sliders for plugins — and VST2
  *instruments* can open their native editor window
  ([docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md)).

Signal order per track: `clip × volume × gain → chain → pan →
output buses`. The same chain runs in export renders.

Writing an effect: copy `template.rs`, rename, edit — one standalone Rust
file that `include!`s `effect_api.rs` and provides `create` / `process` /
`destroy`, a description block (name required, up to 32 parameters), and
optionally a scripted custom GUI. Compiled with
`rustc --edition 2021 --crate-type cdylib`. Working examples in `effects/`:
`parametric_eq.rs` (6-band EQ, live spectrum, draggable log-axis handles)
and `space_echo.rs` (echo + reverb with tone voicing and factory presets).
Scripted **synths** work the same way — `synths/synth_api.rs` plus the
bundled `piano.rs` / `sampler.rs` are the reference.

### MIDI binding

Send events into `slooper:midi_in` (hardware via PipeWire, or
`cargo run --example midi_tester`). Settings → **MIDI bindings**: click an
action's cell (turns blue, *listening…*), send a Note On/Off, CC, or
Program Change — first matching message binds. Velocity/CC value is ignored
for trigger actions, except the **knob** bindings (track vol/gain/pan),
which read the value 0–127 and support the three-step **axis calibration**
wizard (lock min, lock max; inverted travel is handled). Click again / `Esc`
cancels; `Del` clears the binding while listening. **Reset to defaults**
restores the factory table. Old v0.1 shortcut/MIDI tables are migrated
forward automatically (removed actions — overdub, import, dependent-mode,
undo/redo — are dropped).

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | play / stop the whole project (transport toggle) |
| `R` | record toggle on the selected track (take → rack + clip) |
| `C` | clear the selected track's clips |
| `E` | export prompt |
| `M` | metronome on / off |
| `1`–`4` | select track 1–4 (5–16 via the action list) |
| `Ctrl+A` | select all clips (then drag / copy / delete as a group) |
| `Ctrl+S` | save project (asks for a name the first time) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | save under a new name |

Every key is rebindable; keys are ignored while you type in any text box.

### Quantize

Quantization always follows the **metronome** — set BPM / beats-per-measure
/ subdivision in the transport bar, then:

- **quantize** dropdown — the grid an asset's content snaps to (quarter,
  eighth, triplet, sixteenth, triplet-eighths, thirty-second).
- **Quantize** (asset rack, on the selected asset) — snaps the take's
  start/end onto that grid with zero-crossing refinement (±5 ms) and a seam
  crossfade.
- **Trim** — clips silence off the start and end of the selected asset.
- **auto-quantize** checkbox — every fresh recording is quantized
  automatically when it lands in the rack.
- **snap** dropdown + checkbox — the grid dragged clips and auto-placed
  takes snap to; untick **snap** and everything (placement, drags, clip
  resize) lands on any single sample.

```

(`vendor/vst2/` holds the patched, in-tree VST2 crate — see its
`VENDOR-NOTES.md`.)

- `Backend::start()` spawns the **audio manager thread**, which owns the
  `jack::Client` (`NO_START`). GUI ↔ audio run over two bounded channels:
  commands (`Refresh`, `Apply{ins,outs}`, `Quit`, `ToggleRecord`,
  `SetTrackOn`/`ToggleTrackOn`, `PlayAll`, `StopAll`, `Seek`, `SetProject`,
  `SetLoop`, `ExportTrack`, `ExportProject`, `ExportSelection`,
  `SetTrackEffects`, `PreviewPlay`/`PreviewStop`, `SetLatency`,
  `SetMetro`, …) and events (`Ready`, `Ports`, `Applied`, `Midi`,
  `MidiSources`, `Xrun`, `Transport`, `TrackState`, `Take { track, at,
  data }`, `Notice`, errors).
- The client is **never deactivated**: a fixed pool of 16 in / 16 out ports
  is created once; `Apply` only (dis)connects them. Connections retry
  (10 × 25 ms) because PipeWire-JACK rejects connections to
  freshly-activated ports for ~300 ms.
- The realtime `ProcessHandler` walks every lane's clip list and sums the
  active clips into the track bus — no locks, no allocation: the
  arrangement arrives as one `Arc<Arrangement>` swap per edit
  (`Cmd::SetProject`), track states/transport/seek ride atomics, and the
  playhead advances every block while the transport is on (a bare
  metronome ticks on its own free-running clock, leaving the playhead
  frozen; the click itself is output-only, never recorded).
- **Takes**: recording writes into the shared take buffer; when a take
  finishes (REC press or capacity) the engine hands the audio to the
  manager thread (`Evt::Take`), which saves the WAV into the primary rack
  folder, appends the asset, and places the clip at the take's start
  position — opening a child lane when the base lane is occupied there.
  MIDI takes follow the same handshake as `.mid` assets.
- **Loop region**: the engine keeps `loop_start`/`loop_end` samples and a
  mode (area / longest / whole song). `region_end()` resolves the wrap point
  each block (longest = furthest playing clip end, min = the region's end);
  the playhead wraps there, or parks and stops when looping is off. The UI
  pushes the region whenever the handles move; area handles drag on the ruler
  with snap, mirrored live from the RT position stream so dragging keeps up.

## Packaging (Arch / AUR)

The Arch `PKGBUILD` **does not live in this repository** (AUR convention: the
packaging recipe is maintained in its own AUR package repo, `slooper`,
building from this project's GitHub **release tag tarball**). Once the package
is published, see [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for install/build
instructions.

Repo-side obligations that keep the package healthy:

- Every release is a **tag** (`git tag v0.3.0 && git push origin v0.3.0`) —
  the PKGBUILD's `source=` URL points at that tarball, so don't force-move
  public tags once the AUR package references them; release new versions
  instead.
- `assets/icon.png` — **placeholder** blank icon; drop the final artwork over
  this file (the package installs whatever is in it).
- `slooper.desktop` — application-menu entry (`Icon=slooper`).
- `tests/packaging.sh` — packaging regression test (PKGBUILD syntax, required
  fields, version sync with Cargo.toml, referenced files, desktop entry,
  icon, and dependency resolvability). It reads the PKGBUILD from the AUR
  checkout: `PKGBUILD_PATH=~/aur/slooper/PKGBUILD ./tests/packaging.sh --full`.

⚠️ Packaging footguns that still apply when testing from an AUR checkout:
never run `makepkg -C` inside a *copy of this project* (`-C` wipes `$PWD/src`,
i.e. the Rust sources), and prefer a dedicated build dir over in-tree builds —
makepkg's default `$srcdir=$PWD/src` collides with Rust's own `src/`.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

Unit tests (128 + 1 bin) cover MIDI parsing/binding and shortcut-table
migration, the SMF pattern round-trip, synth script loading/rendering,
quantize/silence-trim math, the arrangement model (placement, snapping,
edge trimming, child-lane creation on overlap, removal rules), chain
persistence, the asset store, the `.slooper` project format, engine
render/mixing, and the egui layer driven headlessly (clicks and drags
through the real UI, incl. the v0.6/v0.7 acceptance pins for group editing,
clip trimming, the piano roll, and the chain window). The e2e suite (8
tests) drives a real JACK client pair in real time: MIDI monitor, audio
mixing/routing, the global transport (play/stop anywhere, seek, loop wrap),
the metronome grid, the record → take → clip pipeline, MIDI capture, VST
processing in export, and export. Tests self-skip when no
JACK/PipeWire server is running; the e2e tests serialize on a shared lock
(`E2E_LOCK`) and need a running server.
Packaging is covered by `tests/packaging.sh` (see the Packaging section).
